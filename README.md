This is a script that uses [WinGET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) to install all the software I normally use on my computers

The website [winstall.app](https://winstall.app/) was helpfull for finding software and generating commands.

It is recommended that you run the script as Administrator so that you don't need to accept every single install
